Just a little thing I wanted. I was pouring ground coffee into my aeropress and some was spilling.
This funnel ended up being a little smaller than expected. It is only about an inch bigger, in diameter,
then the aeopress filter itself. And it is fairly thin, almost flimsy. But it turns out that this is
enough. I can use this and I am not spilling ground coffee and if you are going to waste a bit of
plastic, at least do a small thing.
